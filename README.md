# Clinic
A Management Information System (MIS) that is used to keep track of
patient details at a clinic.

# Task
The assignment required us to create a C++ program that uses functions
and can read and write to files.

# Features
The project is able to:
* Capture and store patient details in a .xls file
* View the stored patient details
* Generate reports that determine the appointment dates for patients
* View the details for patients whose appointments are due

# Getting Started
To get a copy of this project onto your local machine, simply click the
*clone* button at the top of the page and follow the prompts.

## Prerequisites
Windows users need to install a compiler for C++ for this project to
run. Cygwin is a trusted compiler and can be downloaded
[here](https://www.cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe). Installation
instructions provide a guide for [setting up](https://cygwin.com/)
Cygwin. 

Linux users do not need to install a C++ compiler since one
comes pre-installed. 

# Usage
